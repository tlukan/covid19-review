## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### General Background

On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first report concerning what is now known as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
This infectious disease came to international attention on December 31, 2019 following an announcement by national officials in China describing 44 cases of a respiratory infection of unknown cause.
The first known cases were located in Wuhan City within the Hubei province of China, but the disease spread rapidly beyond Wuhan to throughout China and subsequently around the world.
At the time of the WHO's first situation report [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf], 282 confirmed cases had been identified.
Most of these cases were in China, but 1-2 exported cases had also been identified in each of several neighboring countries (Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea).
One week later, 4,593 confirmed cases had been identified, spanning not only Asia, but also Australia, North America, and Europe [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200128-sitrep-8-ncov-cleared.pdf].
On March 11, 2020, WHO formally classified the situation as a pandemic [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf].
On April 4, 2020, the WHO reported that the global number of confirmed cases had surpassed one million [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200404-sitrep-75-covid-19.pdf].
{{csse_deaths}} COVID-19 deaths had been reported worldwide as of {{csse_date_pretty}} (Figure @fig:csse-deaths).

Several review articles on aspects of COVID-19 have already been published.
These have included reviews on the disease epidemiology [@doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008], immunological response [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002], diagnostics [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abc1931], and pharmacological treatments [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6019].
[@doi:10.1038/d41591-020-00026-w] and [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12839] provide relatively brief narrative reviews of progress on some important ongoing COVID-19 research questions.
However, research on these topics is proceeding so quickly that any static review is likely to quickly become dated.

In this review, we seek to consolidate information about the virus in the context of related viruses and to synthesize what is known about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and related diseases.
Further, we aim to amplify the true signal out of the vast noise produced by thousands of publications on the topic [@doi:10.1038/s42254-020-0175-7].
We will critique, sort and distill informative content out of the overwhelming flood of information and help the larger scientific community to be better educated on this critical subject.
Thus, our approach has been to develop a real-time, collaborative effort that welcomes submissions from scientists worldwide.

### About Coronaviruses

#### Coronavirus Genome and Structure

Coronaviruses (CoVs; order *Nidovirales*, family *Coronaviridae*, subfamily *Orthocoronavirinae*) are enveloped viruses with some of the largest viral RNA genomes, ranging from 27 kilobases (Kb) to 32 Kb in length.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome lies in the middle of this range at 29,903 bp [@doi:10/ggjr43].
There are several fundamental genomic characteristics shared by all viruses in the *Nidovirales* order, including being enveloped and non-segmented and having positive-sense (ssRNA+) genomes that contain a large number of non-structural genes originating through ribosomal frameshifting [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1].
Genome organization is highly conserved within the order [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1].
A replicase gene comprises about two-thirds of the genome of coronaviruses.
This polypeptide is translated into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16, except in Gammacoronaviruses, where nsp1 is absent), which form replication machinery used to synthesize viral RNA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25681].
The remaining third of the genome encodes structural proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.
Additional accessory genes are sometimes present between these two regions, depending on the species or strain.
<!-- To do: Add a figure showing the structure of the genome.-->
<!-- Also, everything focuses on S! Should we also talk about others?-->

Coronaviruses are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses.
Among them, alpha and beta coronaviruses infect mammalian species, gamma coronaviruses infect avian species and delta coronaviruses infect both mammalian and avian species [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301].
The viruses were initially subdivided into these genera based on antigenic relationships of the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins but are now divided by phylogenetic clustering.
<!-- this section may be better as a figure panel + legend-->
Phylogenetic analysis of a PCR amplicon fragment from five patients along with the total virus genome of 29.8 Kb indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the B lineage, also known as sarbecovirus, which also includes the human SARS coronavirus [@doi:10/ggjs7j].

Most coronaviruses are considered zoonotic viruses with little to no transmission observed in humans.
A major group of coronaviruses include human coronavirus (HCoV) strains associated with multiple respiratory diseases of varying severity, ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia, with severe symptoms mostly observed in immunocompromised individuals [@doi:10.1086/377612].
Approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans is attributable to four out of six previously known human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) that are globally circulating in the human population [@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9;@doi:10.3390/diseases4030026].
In the past two decades, however, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have been identified, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) although both infections were confined to specific geographic regions [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81;@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9].
The current pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents an acute and rapidly spreading global health crisis with symptoms for reported cases ranging from mild to severe or fatal [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html] and including outcomes such as acute respiratory distress, acute lung injury and other pulmonary complications.
The possibility of asymptomatic cases is also being investigated.
The transmission and mortality rate estimations of COVID-19 remain to be determined.
<!-- I think there are better estimates now (about 50% asymptomatic I think, once you take out the presymptomatic).-->
<!-- Most credible IFR estimates I've seen are between 0.5-1.5%, depending on the population. CFRs will be greater and vary a lot.-->

#### Transmission and Evolution

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to become the third coronavirus causing severe pneumonia in humans to emerge in the 21st century [@doi:10.1016/bs.aivir.2018.01.001]. 
Though the intermediate host serving as the source for the zoonotic introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to human populations has not yet been identified, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been placed within the coronavirus phylogeny through comparative genomic analyses.
Genomic analyses and comparisons to other known coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to have originated in a laboratory -- either purposely engineered and released, or escaped -- and instead evolved naturally in an animal host [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].
Among known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has the closest overall sequence similarity to RaTG13 (~96%) found in a *Rhinolophus affinis* bat [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7], while the receptor binding domain (RBD) is highly similar to that of viruses found in pangolins [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.19.950253].
This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in viral reservoirs of similar hosts; however, current evidence cannot discriminate an origin of the virus before or after zoonotic transfer to humans [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].

In general, respiratory viruses like coronavirus can have multiple routes of person-to-person transmission including droplet transmission (i.e. inhalation for cough, sneeze), aerosol transmission (i.e. virus suspended in air), and contact transmission (i.e. contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes).
Other modes of transmission, such as through touching surfaces or objects and then touching mucous membranes, can also be investigated.
While droplet-based and contact were initially considered to be the primary modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission [@doi:10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9], as additional information has emerged, the possibility of aerosol transmission has also been raised [@doi:10.1126/science.abc6197; @doi:10.1056/NEJMc2004973; @doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa939].
Other aspects of transmission to investigate are the relationship between infectiousness and virus shedding with disease period or symptoms and also the proportions of cases that are attributable to various types of transmission events, such as transmission between relatives, nosocomial transmissions, and other possible types of interactions.
Some information about these characteristics of transmission are available for the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [@doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-385885-6.00009-2; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
For SARS-CoV-2 it is still being investigated whether, in addition to being spread by people who show symptoms,  the virus can be transmitted by people who do not show symptoms [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html], such as during the pre-symptomatic stage of infection or in people with asymptomatic infections.
<!-- I think there are some more recent papers that look at the possibility of infection from asymptomatic individuals.-->

#### Cell Entry and Replication

Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters ranging from 100 to 160 nanometers (nm).
The virion is made up of a lipid envelope in which peplomers of 2-3 spike (S) glycoproteins are anchored, creating a distinctive "crown" shape for which the family of viruses was named [@isbn:978-0781760607; @doi:10/dvvg2h].
The replication process is initiated by the viral spike protein: first, the virus binds to a host cell, and then the viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral genome into the host cytoplasm.
<!-- It seems like this info is on SARS-CoV, not on SARS-CoV-2. I think we should only include the parts that are relevant or maybe note that some things may not be known about SARS-CoV-2, in which case, we make assumptions based on SARS-CoV.-->
The coronavirus spike protein is structured in three segments: the ectodomain, a transmembrane anchor, and an intracellular tail [@doi:10.1128/JVI.02615-14].
The ectodomain contains two subdomains known as the S1 and S2 subunits, with the S1 (N-terminal) subunit guiding the binding of the virus to a host cell receptor and the S2 (C-terminal) subunit guiding the fusion process [@doi:10.1128/JVI.02615-14].
<!-- Is it worth going into more detail about siganl peptides and secretory pathways? Not sure whether this is relevant information.-->
The ectodomain forms the crown-like structures on the viral membrane, with the S1 domain forming the head of the crown and containing the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) that binds a host receptor, while the S2 domain forms the stalk that supports the head [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro2090].
Among betacoronaviruses, some are known to bind to CEACAM1, Neu 5,9 Ac2, and ACE2 [@doi:10.3390/v4061011].
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to ACE2.

After the virus binds to a host cell receptor, the viral and plasma membranes must then fuse.
Many coronaviruses are cleaved at the S1-S2 boundary and remain non-covalently bound until fusion to the host cell is achieved, with the S1 subunit stabilizing the S2 subunit during the membrane fusion process [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058].
This priming of the S protein is induced by the binding of cellular proteases [@doi:10/cf8chz; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792].
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) have been identified as a prime receptor and a critical protease, respectively, facilitating SARS-CoV/CoV-2 entry into a target cell [@doi:10.1038/nature02145; @doi:10.1126/science.abb2507; @doi:10.1128/JVI.01542-10; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; @doi:10.1128/JVI.02232-10].
This finding has led to a hypothesized role for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in determining which cells, tissues and organs are most likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2.
A second cleavage site within S2 is thought to activate _S_ for fusion by inducing conformational change [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058].
Electron microscopy suggests that in some coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a six-helix bundle separates the two subunits in the postfusion conformation, and the unusual length of this bundle facilitates membrane fusion through the release of additional energy [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301].
However, research in SARS-CoV suggests that, in addition to fusion with the plasma membrane, viruses may also be taken up by cells through endocytosis [@doi:10.1038/cr.2008.15].
<!-- This is very interesting and seems like it could be relevant to virulence (?), but I don't know enough cell biology to expand on it. Another reference that seems useful is doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biochem-060208-104626-->
Once the virus enters a host cell, the replicase gene is translated and assembled into the viral replicase complex, which can synthesize dsRNA genome from the genomic ssRNA(+).
Finally, the dsRNA genome is transcribed and replicated to create viral mRNAs and new ssRNA(+) genomes [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1; @url:https://viralzone.expasy.org/30?outline=all_by_species].

Thus, most of the viral entry process is determined by the viral genome, but the initial step, when the virus binds to a host receptor, also depends on the virus being able to recognize the host receptor.
Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV may therefore be engaged in an evolutionary arms race with the human immune system [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.13.093658; @doi:10.1101/2020.05.14.096131; @doi:10.1186/1743-422X-10-304].
Two "hot spots" within human ACE2 have been identified as driving the strong binding affinity between this receptor and two sites in SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301].
Coronaviruses bind to a range of host receptors [@doi:10.3390/v4061011; @doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.009], with binding conserved only at the genus level [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301].
The S1 domain of the spike protein, which contains the RBM, evolves more rapidly than _S_'s S2 domain [@doi:10.3390/v4061011; @doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.009].
However, even within the S1 domain, some regions are more conserved than others, with the receptors in S1's N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) evolving more rapidly than those in its C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) [@doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.009].
Both S1-NTD and S1-CTD are involved in receptor binding and can function as receptor binding domains (RBDs) to bind proteins and sugars [@doi:10.3390/v4061011], but RBDs in the S1-NTD typically bind to sugars, while those in the S1-CTD recognize protein receptors [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301].
Viral receptors show higher affinity with protein receptors than sugar receptors [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301], which suggests that positive selection on or relaxed conservation of the S1-NTD preferentially might reduce the risk of a deleterious mutation that would prevent binding.
<!--also positive selection on MHC/HLA? Seems worth mentioning somewhere, possibly here?...-->
Cell entry by the virus is a critical component to pathogenesis and therefore an important process to understand when examining possible therapeutics.
Pathogenesis is made up of three major components: entry, replication, and spread [@isbn:0-9631172-1-1 {chap. 45}].
<!-- We should probably mention more about spread in this section & add spread to the title... or make a spread section-->

### COVID-19: Infection and Presentation

#### Immunological Mechanisms of Coronavirus-driven Disease in Humans

One way that humans respond to viral threats is through the immune response.
The human immune system utilizes a variety of innate and adaptive responses to protect against the pathogens it encounters.
The innate immune system consists of barriers, such as the skin, mucous secretions, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells.
It also includes cell-surface receptors that can recognize the molecular patterns of pathogens.
The adaptive immune system utilizes antigen-specific receptors that are expressed on B and T lymphocytes.
These components of the immune system typically act together; the innate response acts first, and the adaptive response begins to act several days after initial infection following the clonal expansion of T and B cells [@doi:10.1016/j.jaci.2005.09.034].

After a virus enters into a host cell, its antigen is presented by major histocompatibility complex 1 (MHC 1) molecules and is then recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
One of the main immune responses that contribute to the onset of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients is the cytokine storm, which causes an extreme inflammatory response due to a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune effector cells.
In addition to respiratory distress, this mechanism leads to organ failure and death in severe COVID-19 cases [@doi:10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.001].

#### Clinical Presentation of COVID-19

A great diversity of symptom profiles has been observed for COVID-19, although a large study from Wuhan, China suggests fever and cough as the two most common symptoms on admission [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2002032].
One early retrospective study in China described the clinical presentations of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 as including lower respiratory tract infection with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
This study [@doi:10/ggnxb3] noted that upper respiratory tract symptoms were less common, which suggests that the virus targets cells located in the lower respiratory tract.
However, data from the New York City region [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6775; @doi:10.1056/NEJMc2010419] showed variable rates of fever as a presenting symptom, suggesting that symptoms may not be consistent across samples.
These differences are present when comparing both between institutions in similar locations and between different regions experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, leading to conflicting reports of the frequency of fever as a presenting symptom for patients upon hospital admission.
For example, even within New York City, one study [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6775] identified low oxygen saturation (<90% without the use of supplemental oxygen or ventilation support) in a significant percentage of patients on presentation, while another study [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2010419] reported cough, fever, and dyspnea as the most common presenting symptoms.
The variability of both which symptoms present and their severity makes it difficult for public health agencies to provide clear recommendations for citizens regarding what symptoms indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection and should prompt isolation.

The significant range of individual outcomes observed has led to interest in which factors influence disease severity.
The reported hospitalization rates have been wide-ranging and appear to be influenced by age and location, with several underlying health conditions being disproportionately reported among hospitalized patients [@doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3].
<!--Should emphasize that the risk goes up a lot with age, with maleness and diabetes/obesity also being risk factors.-->
Among patients who are admitted to the hospital, outcomes have generally been poor, with rates of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) upwards of 15% in both Wuhan, China and Italy [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2002032; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2648; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4031].
Several studies have also investigated which factors are likely to influence COVID-19 outcomes.
For example, a Chinese retrospective study [@doi:10/ggnxb3] found that a higher probability of mortality was associated with older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, as well as high levels of d-dimer.
Mortality might be associated with other biomarkers measured in blood samples including lactate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I, although these analyses may not have been appropriately corrected for multiple testing.
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] reported that survivors continued to shed the virus for a median of 20 days and a maximum of at least 37 days.
A later study reported radiographic findings such as ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing in the lungs of many hospitalized patients, and most COVID-19 patients had lymphocytopenia, meaning they had low levels of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2002032].

COVID-19 can affect diverse body systems in addition to causing respiratory problems [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0968-3].
For example, COVID-19 can lead to acute kidney injury, especially in patients with severe respiratory symptoms or certain preexisting conditions [@doi:10.1016/j.kint.2020.05.006].
It can also cause neurological complications [@doi:10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.031; @doi:10/d259], potentially including stroke, seizures or meningitis [@doi:10.1002/jmv.26000; @doi:10.1002/ana.25807].

COVID-19 has also been associated with an increased incidence of large vessel stroke, particularly in patients under the age of 40 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2009787], and other thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis [@doi:10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013].
The mechanism behind these complications has been suggested to be related to coagulopathy with reports of antiphospholipid antibodies present [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2007575] and elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) elevated in deceased patients [@doi:10.1111/jth.14768].
Other viral infections have been associated with coagulation defects; notably SARS was also found to lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and was associated with both pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis [@doi:10.1002/jmv.23354].
A wide range of viral infections can affect the coagulation cascade.
The mechanism behind these insults has been suggested to be related to inflammation-induced increases in the von Willebrand factor (VWF) clotting protein, leading to a pro-coagulative state [@doi:10.1002/jmv.23354].
Abnormal clotting (thromboinflammation or coagulopathy) has been increasingly discussed recently as a possible key mechanism in many cases of severe COVID-19, and may be associated with the high d-dimer levels often observed in severe cases [@doi:10/ggvd74; @doi:10.1186/s13054-020-03060-9; @doi:10.1007/s11239-020-02134-3].
This excessive clotting in lung capillaries has been suggested to be related to a dysregulated activation of the complement system, part of the innate immune system [@doi:10.1172/jci.insight.140711;@doi:10.1172/JCI140183].

The presentation of COVID-19 infection can vary greatly among pediatric patients and in some cases manifests in distinct ways from COVID-19 in adults. 
[@doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1467] reviewed 17 studies on children infected with COVID-19 during the early months of the COVID-19 epidemic in China and one study from Singapore.
Of the more than a thousand cases described, the most commonly reports were for mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, nasal congestion and/or runny nose, while three children were reported to be asymptomatic.
Severe lower respiratory infection was described in only one of the pediatric cases reviewed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea were occasionally reported.
Radiologic findings were not always reported in the case studies reviewed by [@doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1467], but when they were mentioned they included bronchial thickening, ground-glass opacities, and/or inflammatory lesions.
Neurological symptoms have also been reported [@doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.2687].

These analyses indicate that generally, most pediatric cases of COVID-19 are not severe.  
However, serious complications and, in rare cases, death have occurred [@doi:10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100433]. 
Of particular interest, children have occasionally experienced a serious inflammatory syndrome, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), after COVID-19 infection; this syndrome is similar in some respects to Kawasaki disease or to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome [@doi:10.1093/jpids/piaa069;@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.10369; @doi:10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.117].
MIS-C has been associated with heart failure in some cases [@doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.048360].
[@doi:10/gg4sd6] reported a single case of an adult who appeared to show symptoms similar to MIS-C after exposure to COVID-19, but cautioned against broad conclusions; [@doi:10.1016/j.ajem.2020.06.053] reported another such possible adult case.

#### Subpopulations of Special Concern  

In the context of the United States, persons diagnosed with COVID-19 are more likely to require hospitalization if they are of male sex, of older age, and/or of Black/African American background [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598; @doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6925e1].
African Americans have also been reported to have disproportionate risk of kidney complications from COVID-19 [@doi:10.1016/j.kint.2020.05.006].
In addition to African Americans, disproportionate harm and mortality from COVID-19 has also been noted in Latino/Hispanic communities and in Native American / Alaskan Native communities such as the Navajo nation [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.8598; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m1483; @doi:10.1111/jrh.12451; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-navajo-nation.html?searchResultPosition=10; @url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html; @doi:10.1093/tbm/ibaa055].
In Brazil, where the pandemic has also been severe, indigenous communities are likewise at special risk [@doi:10.1126/science.abc0073].
The sizable racial disparities observed may be due to a number of factors, including different levels of pre-existing co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes or lung diseases.
They may also be influenced by the disproportionate socioeconomic burdens placed on many people of color, which can correspond to greater economic difficulties, more hazardous or crowded work or living conditions, or reduced access to health care [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598; @doi:10.1016/j.kint.2020.05.006; @doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.12403].
This might cause infections to be less likely to be diagnosed unless or until they were very severe; in the sample studied by [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598], African Americans were more likely to be diagnosed in hospital, while other groups were more likely to have been diagnosed in ambulatory settings in the community.
More research is needed for analyzing and remediating these disparities [@doi:10.1093/tbm/ibaa055]. 

People living in certain locations may be especially vulnerable to harm.
In a preprint, [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502] provided observational evidence that geographical areas in the United States that suffer from worse air pollution by fine particulate matter have also suffered more COVID-19 deaths per capita, after adjusting for demographic covariates.
Although lack of individual-level exposure data and the impossibility of randomization make it difficult to elucidate the exact causal mechanism, this finding would be consistent with similar findings for all-cause mortality (e.g., [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1803222115]).
Individuals in nursing homes / skilled nursing facilities [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.11642] and in some prisons and detention centers [@doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.1856; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12528] have also been exposed to higher risk of infection.
Certain occupations, such as health care work, can put individuals at increased risk [@doi:10.1002/ajim.23145; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0232452; @url:https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregistereduptoandincluding20april2020; @url:https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichoccupationshavethehighestpotentialexposuretothecoronaviruscovid19/2020-05-11;
@url:https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892085/disparities_review.pdf].

Many other factors influence risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. 
Genetic factors may play a role in risk of respiratory failure for COVID-19 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2020283; @doi:10.1093/gerona/glaa131; @doi:10.1101/2020.06.16.155101].
Diabetes may increase the risk of lengthy hospitalization [@doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.021] or of death [@doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.021;@doi:10.1007/s00592-020-01546-0].
[@doi:10.1111/dom.14057] and [@doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00124.2020] discuss possible ways in which COVID-19 and diabetes may interact.
Obesity also appears to be associated with higher risk of severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154262; @doi:10.1101/2020.04.23.20076042].
Obesity is considered an underlying risk factor for other health problems, and the mechanism for its contributions to COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality is not yet clear [@doi:10.1016/j.medj.2020.06.005].

Study of disparities and differences among groups in rates of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 are complicated by the fact that risk may be elevated in multiple ways.
An individual may be more likely to be exposed to the virus, more likely to get infected once exposed, more likely to have serious complications once infected, be less likely to get adequate help once they are seriously ill.
Although these are difficult to disaggregate, they suggest different possible interventions and each deserves consideration.
The epidemiological characteristics and clinical presentation of COVID-19 may differ somewhat in different areas of the world, presumably due to differential reporting, different age structures, and/or different risk factors [@doi:10.1007/s00592-020-01546-0].
Furthermore, because different subpopulations may have somewhat different vulnerabilities, needs, and resources, we recommend that researchers publishing studies on diagnostics and therapeutics take extra care to be clear about the demographic and medical characteristics of their sample, in order to facilitate discussions of the degree to which results may generalize or differ in other settings.

Several studies on disparities in COVID-19 have compared groups in terms of their probability of a severe outcome (like hospitalization or death) given that a person is diagnosed.  
The larger population of all exposed or all infected people usually cannot directly be studied, or even identified, because of the existence of undetected infections.  
In contrast, [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2521-4] were able to compare overall rates of death from COVID-19, not simply in the subsample of diagnosed individuals, thus combining the probability of infection with the probability of death given infection.  
This was done using a dataset of 17 million adults in the United Kingdom.  
In this administrative dataset, [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2521-4] found that male sex, older age, economic deprivation, nonwhite ethnicity (principally Black or South Asian), obesity, diabetes,  asthma, and several other comorbid conditions were associated with a higher risk of death from COVID-19. 
They cautioned that despite the large sample size, their observational data did not directly provide information on the causal mechanisms which led to these statistical associations.  
However, the ethnic and economic disparities did not vanish when adjusting for observed preexisting conditions.  
[@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2521-4] also found that the predictive value of socioeconomic status seemed to increase over time, perhaps because many higher-paid workers were able to transition to working online.
 
Besides the direct harms caused by infection, many populations are in indirect risk of serious harm due to the social and economic effects of the pandemic and of the efforts needed to fight it.  
These might include individuals with substance use disorder [@doi:10.7326/M20-1141], victims of natural disasters [@doi:10.1038/s41558-020-0804-2], and victims of human trafficking [@doi:10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100409].
The pandemic could also delay the fight against other major infectious diseases, such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, potentially leading to a further increase of mortality [@doi:10.25561/78670].
Although they are beyond the scope of this paper, further research is needed in order to prevent these harms.

#### Molecular Mechanisms of COVID-19

<!-- How can we evaluate the human response to SARS-CoV-2 on a molecular level?-->
<!-- What can omics technologies tell us about changes in the body following SARS-CoV-2 infection?-->
 
Most of our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 infects cells is obtained from studies on previously identified coronaviruses. 
The entry of a coronavirus into a target cell is mediated by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to a specific cellular receptor and the subsequent priming/cleavage of the S protein by cellular proteases [@doi:10/cf8chz; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792]. 
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) have been identified as a prime receptor and a critical protease, respectively, facilitating SARS-CoV/CoV-2 entry into a target cell [@doi:10.1038/nature02145; @doi:10.1126/science.abb2507; @doi:10.1128/JVI.01542-10; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; @doi:10.1128/JVI.02232-10]. 
This finding has led to a hypothesized role for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in determining which cells, tissues and organs are most likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Recent clinical investigations of COVID-19 patients have detected SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (93% of specimens), sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), fibrobronchoscopy brush biopsies (46%), pharyngeal swabs (32%), feces (29%) and blood (1%) [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3786]. 
Two studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the urine specimens [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3786; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3204]; however, a third study identified four urine samples (out of 58) that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids [@doi:10.1097/CM9.0000000000000774]. 
Respiratory failure remains the leading cause of death for COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1111/his.14134]. 
Besides major pulmonary damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage many other organ systems including the heart [@doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950], kidney [@doi:10.1038/s41585-020-0319-7; @doi:10.1186/s13054-020-02872-z], liver [@doi:10/ggpx6s], and gastrointestinal tract [@doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.055; @doi:10.1111/1751-2980.12851]. 
As it becomes clearer that SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage multiple organs, the scientific community is pursuing multiple avenues of investigation in order to build a consensus about how the virus affects the human body.
To quickly associate the clinical outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers are taking advantage of “omics” technologies to profile the expression of coronavirus entry factors across the tissues.

### Approaches to Understanding COVID-19

Scientific characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and of the COVID-19 disease it causes is critical to controlling the current pandemic.
Several broad areas of research interact with each other, offering different pieces of information critical to understanding the virus and disease.
A comprehensive understanding of the epidemic must unify basic scientific and medical research with public health and biotechnology.

#### Science & Medicine

Understanding how the virus functions and interacts with the host is foundational to understanding pathogenesis and disease progression and to identifying available and novel approaches to treatment.
Therefore, the fields of virology, immunology, and molecular biology are fundamental to characterizing SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
These topics can be approached using a range of techniques, including characterization of the host response from the cellular to systems level.
Contextualizing SARS-CoV-2 in relation to other viruses that infect humans and other animals can further serve to elucidate the reaction of the human host to viral exposure.
This information, when combined with an understanding of the biology of pharmaceutical and medical interventions, can guide new approaches to treatment.

#### Public Health

One necessary component of determining how to manage the outbreak is to understand epidemiological factors related to the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These can include characteristics such as when infected individuals are contagious, how the virus is transmitted between individuals, the range of symptoms associated with infection and/or contagiousness in different individuals, and how rapidly the virus propagates between individuals, etc.
The development of diagnostic tools is critical to this goal.
Accurate diagnoses on a large scale is necessary to collect the data needed to develop epidemiological models.
Other areas of public health that address resource availability, inequity, human behavior, and other components that influence people's exposure to pathogens and ability to manage illness will also be critical to mounting a global response to the pandemic.
Public health strategies to manage epidemics include anticipation and early detection of emerging diseases (aided by rapid development of diagnostics), containment (using strategies to test, trace and isolate such as widespread testing, contact tracing, quarantining and isolation), control and mitigation of spread (including social distancing), and elimination and eradication. 
An effective public health response requires response coordination, disease surveillance and intervention monitoring, risk communication and health education (including education about personal protective equipment and hand hygiene and containment of “infodemics” of false information), non-pharmaceutical measures to prevent and reduce transmission, and health interventions such as vaccines and other pharmaceuticals that can reduce transmission, curb morbidity and mortality, and mitigate the effects on health systems and other sectors of society [@isbn:978-92-4-156553-0].
<!--I think non-pharmaceutical interventions are already in categories above (tracing, social distancing, lockdowns etc)-->
Currently, this manuscript focuses primarily on contextualizing epidemiological characteristics such as reproduction number and dynamics of transmission that intersect with the fundamental biology of the virus or the development of therapeutic and diagnostic technologies.

#### Biotechnology

##### Diagnostics

Two major concerns within diagnosis include the detection of current infections in individuals with and without symptoms, and the detection of past exposure without an active infection.
In the latter category, identifying whether individuals can develop or have developed sustained immunity is also a major consideration.
The development of high-throughput, affordable methods for detecting active infections and sustained immunity will be critical to understanding and controlling the disease.

<!-- What are approaches that allow us to detect current infection or past exposure for other viruses?-->
<!-- What is sustained immunity and what are the indicators?-->

##### Therapeutics

The identification of interventions that can mitigate the effect of the virus on exposed and infected individuals is a significant research priority.
Some possible approaches include the identification of existing pharmaceuticals that reduce the severity of infection, either by reducing the virus' virulence (e.g., antivirals) or managing the most severe symptoms of infection.
Due to the long timeline for the development of novel pharmaceuticals, in most cases, research surrounding possible pharmaceutical interventions focuses on the identification and investigation of existing compounds whose mechanisms may be relevant to COVID-19.
Other foci of current research include the identification of antibodies produced by survivors of COVID-19 and the development of vaccines.
Understanding the mechanisms describing host-virus interactions between humans and SARS-CoV-2 is thus critical to identifying candidate therapeutics.

### Summary
In this review, we seek to consolidate information about efforts to develop strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics as new information is released by the scientific community.
We include information from both traditional peer-reviewed scientific literature and from preprints, which typically have not undergone peer review but have been critically evaluated by the scientists involved in this effort.
The goal of this manuscript is to present preliminary findings within the broader context of COVID-19 research and to identify the broad interpretations of new research, as well as limitations to interpretability.
